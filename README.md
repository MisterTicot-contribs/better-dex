# Introduction

This is a search about what's currently missing at protocol level so we can
implement a top-level exchange on top of it.

I started by listing the important orders that need to be available at
software-level.

I then searched what was the minimal required set of operations for them to be
*properly* implemented.

I concluded with a small set of protocol changes.

If it takes off I'll add a page that shows how the higher level orders can be
implemented on top of that − I did the work but didn't wrote it as an organized
file yet.
